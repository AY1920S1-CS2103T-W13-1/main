== PROJECT: ModuleBook - AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1

---

== Overview

As part of the project requirement of CS2103T offered by NUS, my team of 4 software engineering students a I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We decided to morph the addressbook into a module management application called ModuleBook designed specifically for NUS students.

ModuleBook is a desktop module manager application designed with the needs of NUS students in mind, to streamline the process of managing time and resources related to the modules offered by NUS. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

As of the current build (v1.3), ModuleBook offeres the following features:

. Detailed archive of all modules offered by NUS (adaped from NUSMods API).
. Track modules of interest.
. Search for specific modules using search filters.
. Add personalised deadlines to tracked modules.
. Add links to tracked modules.

My role was to adapt and migrate the base code of addressbook to the requirements of ModuleBook, as well as to design and enhance the codes for operations related to tracking a module. This includes the add, delete, list and find command.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to find specific modules using filtered search.*
** What it does: Allows the user to search for modules by filtering any combination of the following categories:
. module code
. description
. prerequsite modules
. precluded modules
. semesters the modules are offered
** Justification: This feature should be very useful for freshmen students, or students who are unfamiliar with the large selection of modules offered by NUS. These students would be able to able to find a module of their interest without requiring in depth knowledge of specific details related to these modules.
** Highlights: This enhancement made extensive use of predicate chaining to filter modules based on user requirements. Given the somewhat limited information provided by the NUSMods API, this feature provides a near complete coverage of searchable details for each module.
** Credits: Module information is directly adapted from the API provided by NUSMods. The adaptation and storage of module information is done by Ge Shuming, one of the students involved in this project. Without these information, this feature would not be possible.

* *Minor enhancement*: improved the base add and delete module commands to be more in line with the program specifics.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/module/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[Functional code]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/module/logic/parser/FindCommandParserTest.java[Test code]]

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
We had to update the original addressbook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. The following is an excerpt from our ModuleBook User Guide, showing additions that I have made for the add, delete and find commands.
|===

=== Finding an archived module: `find`

Find archived modules with the the given prefix and keyword. +
Format: `find PREFIX\ KEYWORD ...`

****
* Prefixes: (case sensitive)
** `mod\` : Find all modules with module code that contains the given keyword(s).
*** Example: `find module\ cs ma st` will list all modules with module code containing `cs` or `ma` or `st`.
** `desc\` : Find all modules with description that contains the given keyword or sentence.
*** Example: `find desc\ software engineering` will list all modules with description containing `"software engineering"`.
** `prereq\` : Find all modules with prerequisites that match the given keyword(s).
*** Example: `find prereq\ cs2030 cs2040` will list all modules with prerequisite of `cs2030` or `cs2040`.
** `preclu\` : Find all modules with preclusion that match the given keyword(s).
*** Example: `find preclu\ cs2030 cs2040` will list all modules with preclusion of `cs2030` or `cs2040`.
** `sem\` : Find all modules offered in a particular sem 1 - 4. (Sem 3 and 4 are special terms 1 and 2).
*** Example: `find sem\ 1 3` will list all modules offered in semester 1 or special term 1.
* The prefixes can be used together in any order to filter modules that passes all the search requirements.
** Example: `find module\ cs2 cs3 desc\ software engineering sem\ 1` will show all modules with module code containing `cs2`
or `cs3` with description containing `"software engineering"` offered in semester 1.
* The keywords are case insensitive. e.g `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.
****

[TIP]
Modules are imported from NUSMods database.

=== Adding a module: `add`

Adds a module to be tracked. +
Format: `add MODULE_CODE`
****
* The add is case insensitive. e.g `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.
* Only module code is searched for module to be added.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `cs2103` will not match `cs2103t`.
****
[TIP]
Modules are imported from NUSMods database.

Examples:

* `add cs2103t`

=== Deleting a module: `delete`

Untracks a module. +
Format: `delete MODULE_CODE`
****
* The delete is case insensitive. e.g `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.
* Only module code is searched for module to be added.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `cs2103` will not match `cs2103t`.
****

Examples:

* `delete cs2103t`

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
This section also contains an excerpt for the filtered find feature in the ModuleBook Developer Guide.

=== Search filtering feature
==== Implementation

The search filtering feature Uses different categories of predicates
to narrow down the search space of the archived module list. The user is able to able to combine different categories
of search to find modules that passes all the user defined filters. This can be achieved through the use of `Predicate`
which can be chained with additional predicates and applied to a `FilteredList`. This requires additional predicate classes that searches their individual fields
for the keywords.:

* `ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` -- Tests that a `module` module code matches any of the keywords given.
* `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` -- Tests that a `module` description matches the keyword or sentence given.
* `PrerequisiteContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` prerequisites matches any of the keywords given.
* `PreclusionContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` preclusions matches any of the keywords given.
* `SemesterContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` semester matches any of the keywords given.

The user is able to use any combination of filters and the order of input should not matter. Examples of valid find commands:

****
* `find module\ cs2` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs2"
* `find module\ cs2 prereq\ cs2040` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs" and with prerequisite of "cs2040"
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation wold work:

.Proposed sequence diagram for search filtering.

NOTE: The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

As represented in Fig 9, when a `FindCommandParser` is constructed by `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand`, the `FindCommandParser` would construct a list
of `Predicate<module>` based on the parsed arguments, which is used to construct a `FindCommand`.

During the execution of `FindCommand#execute()`, each predicate is chained and applied to the `FilteredList`.

Finally, a `FilteredList` of `Modules` that passes all of the filters will be displayed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Requirements.

* **Module field requirements:** Information from the `archivedModules.json` would have to be abstracted out
as individual fields in the `ArchivedModule` object.
** pros: Added fields can be used for future developments.
** cons: Can potentially slow down `Module` construction and operations due to increased size for each `Module` object.

===== Aspect: Incremental development.

* **Adding new search filters:** Developing and integrating new filters.
** pros: Filters can be developed independently and incrementally, filters can be integrated based on priority.
** pros: Can be further adapted to search fields from `Deadline` and `Links`.
