== PROJECT: ModuleBook

== Overview

My team of four cs2103T software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface
desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a module management
cum planning system called ModuleBook.

This application is tailored to meet the needs of NUS students’ module management problems. It enables students to
find modules, plan modules for semesters, manage module-specific deadlines and quick-links. ModuleBook is a desktop
application where user interacts with it using CLI, and it has GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

This is what our projects look like:

My role was to design and write codes for the management of module deadline feature. The following sections illustrate
these enhancements in more details, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.


== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major Enhancement:*
Added the ability to add, edit, delete, mark as done or in-progress, tag and sort the deadline tasks specific to
each module.

** What it does: Allows users to input deadline tasks with description, date, time and priority tag using Add command.
Deadline task is colored to indicate priority. Deadline tasks are sorted according to priority, date and time.
Users can edit description, date and time of an existing deadline task using Edit command. Delete command removes
the deadline task. Done and in-progress marks the deadline task’s status as done and in-progress respectively.
Users can undo done and in-progress marking via Undone.

** Justification: This is especially beneficial feature to NUS students as it helps students to keep track of the
surmountable deadlines. Since deadlines are found in various platforms such as emails, Luminus and lecture
announcements, students can now add and manage all deadline in one place, ModuleBook. Deadline feature is extremely
flexible to use as users can easily edit the due date and time if deadlines are rescheduled. Students can simply mark
deadlines as done, in progress and undo to constantly track their progress. Deadline feature is found in Module view
which allows users to easily navigate and check the deadline tasks.

** Highlights: This enhancement enables automatic sorting of deadlines according to priority, date and time when user
adds a deadline task. There is no need for users to sort again after adding deadline tasks.

** Credits: Module information is directly adapted from API provided by NUSMods.

* *Minor Enhancement:* Users can enter deadline commands from anywhere in the ModuleBook, both the
homepage and Module view. Refractored deadline commands and parsers.

== Contributions to the User Guide

We had to update the original Addressbook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added.
The following is an excerpt from our ModuleBook User Guide, showing additions that
I have made for the *3.9 Manage deadline tasks*.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
Implementation details for the respective deadline command is explained in the Developer guide.
The example of AddDeadlineCommand is used to demonstrate the implementation as the other commands are fairly similar.
Activity diagram for the execution of  AddDeadlineCommand is added.
Explained the mechanism of how add deadline behaves from user input to adding deadline task to deadline list.
How the add deadline operation works with the interaction of relevant classes is shown using a sequence diagram.
