== Introduction

ModuleBook is a standalone application that tracks and manages modules from National University of Singapore (NUS). The application contains many features useful for module management, such as deadline tracking, lesson scheduling and grade calculator.

ModuleBook is for NUS students who *want a desktop app for managing modules*. More importantly, ModuleBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ModuleBook can manage your tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
//.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all modules
* **`add`**`cs2103t` : adds a module with module code `cs2103t` to be tracked by ModuleBook.
* **`delete`**`cs2103t` : deletes module with code `cs2103t`
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `MODULE_CODE [MODULE_TITLE]` can be used as `CS1231 discrete structures`
//* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
