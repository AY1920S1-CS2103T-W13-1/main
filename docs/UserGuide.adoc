== Introduction

ModuleBook is a standalone application that tracks and manages trackedModules from National University of Singapore (NUS). The application contains many features useful for trackedModule management, such as deadline tracking, lesson scheduling and grade calculator.

ModuleBook is for NUS students who *want a desktop app for managing trackedModules*. More importantly, ModuleBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ModuleBook can manage your tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
//.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all trackedModules
* **`add`**`cs2103t` : adds a trackedModule with trackedModule code `cs2103t` to be tracked by ModuleBook.
* **`delete`**`cs2103t` : deletes trackedModule with code `cs2103t`
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add CS1101S`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `MODULE_CODE [MODULE_TITLE]` can be used as `CS1231 discrete structures`
//* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a trackedModule: `add`

Adds a trackedModule to be tracked +
Format: `add MODULE_CODE`

[TIP]
Modules are imported from Nusmods database


Examples:

* `add cs2103t`
* `add manual MODULE_CODE (not in database)`

=== View the trackedModule: `view`

View a tracked trackedModule and enters trackedModule viewing mode. In trackedModule viewing, a different set of commands are available [see <<Module-View>>].

Format: `view MODULE_CODE`

Example: `view cs1231`


=== Listing all trackedModules : `list`

Shows a list of all current tracked trackedModules. +
Format: `list`


////
=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing trackedModule in the address book. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the trackedModule at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed trackedModule list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the trackedModule will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the trackedModule's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st trackedModule to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd trackedModule to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

=== Locating trackedModules by name: `find`

Finds trackedModules whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `computing` will match `Computing`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `software engineering` will match `engineering software`
* Only trackedModule code and trackedModule title are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `computer` will not match `computers`
//* Modules matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find computer` +
Returns `cs2100` and `cs2105`
* `find Betsy Tim John`?? +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a trackedModule : `delete`

Untrack the specified trackedModule from ModuleBook. +
Format: `delete MODULE_CODE`

****
* Deletes trackedModule associated with specified `MODULE_CODE`.
****

Examples:

* `delete cs2100` +
  Removes trackedModule CS2100 from tracked trackedModule list.

////
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.
////

// end::delete[]

////
=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
////


== Module-View

Program enters trackedModule-view when `view` is called. In this mode, a different set of features are implemented.

=== Delete

Remove current viewed trackedModule. Returns to normal view.

=== Grade Manager

Tracks grades inputted by the user.

=== Deadline Manager

User can add and manage deadlines

=== File Manager `[coming in v2.0]`

Users can add files related to the trackedModule, and open them.

=== CAP Calculator

Calculates the cumulative GPA of all tracked trackedModules.
*To be implemented*

=== Back

Exits trackedModule-view and return to trackedModule list

== FAQ
