== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add CS2103T`.

.Component interactions for `add CS2103T` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModuleBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add CS2103T")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `Add CS2103T` Command
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the ModuleBook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `TrackedModule` data in json format and read it back.
* can read the `ArchivedModule` data from json format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.module.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::moduleview[]
=== Module View Feature

The module view feature allows users to view a module to access extra information about the module. The user can view (and unview) a module using the `view` (and `back`) commands.

==== Implementation
The module view feature is facilitated by `displayedModule` in `ModelManager`. The following describes how the `displayedModule` is modified and read to the `Ui`.

. The user enters a view command in the `Ui`.

. `LogicManager` parses the user input, constructs and executes the `ViewCommand`.

. The `ViewCommand` attempts to find the matching module from the list of Tracked Modules, else it attempts to find the matching module from the list of Archived Modules, else it throws an exception.

. The `ViewCommand` sets the `displayedModule` in the `Model` and returns the `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

. The `LogicManager` returns the `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

. The `Ui` gets the `displayedModule` from `LogicManager` and updates the Ui to display the module.

The following sequence diagram shows how the module view feature is executed.

.Module View Sequence Diagram
image::ModuleViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The `BackCommand` mostly follows the same sequence as described above, except that it does not need to find any module, and sets the displayed module to `null`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ViewCommand` attempts to find the module from the `Model`.

.Reference Diagram for finding a matching module
image::ModuleViewSequenceDiagram_FindModule.png[]

[NOTE]
`TrackedModule` composes of an `ArchivedModule`. If a `TrackedModule` is found, it is guaranteed the corresponding `ArchivedModule` can be found.

==== Design Considerations

===== Updating the Ui

**Current Implementation**: New field in the `CommandResult` that the Ui will check to determine if it needs to update.

Pros:

* Simple and easy to control what command updates the Ui.

Cons:

* More difficult to maintain over the course of the project. New Ui elements require new fields to update the Ui.

**Alternate Implementation**: Every command updates the Ui.

Pros:

* Maintainance free.

Cons:

* Potentially inefficient.
* Possible side effects from certain commands.
// end::moduleview[]

// tag::searchfitering[]
=== [Proposed] Search filtering feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The search filtering feature would be an enhancement to the current available search feature. Using different categories of predicates
to narrow down the search space of the archived module list. The user should be able to able to combine different categories
of search to find modules that passes all the user defined filters. This can be achieved through the use of `FilteredList`
which can be updated incrementally with each filter applied. This would require additional classes that searches their individual fields
for the keywords. For example:

* `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` -- Tests that a `module` description matches any of the keywords given.
* `PrerequisiteContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` prerequisites matches any of the keywords given.
* `PreclusionContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` preclusions matches any of the keywords given.
* `ModuleCreditContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` credits matches any of the keywords given.
* `PreclusionContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` preclusions matches any of the keywords given.
* `SemesterContainsKeywordsPredicate()#test()` -- Tests that a `module` semester matches any of the keywords given.

The user should be able to use any combination of filters and the order of input should not matter. Examples of valid find commands:

****
* `find module\cs2` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs2"
* `find module\cs2 prereq\ cs2040` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs" and with prerequisite of "cs2040"
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation wold work:

.Proposed sequence diagram for search filtering.
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

As represented in Fig 9, when a `FindCommandParser` is constructed by `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand`, the `FindCommandParser` would construct a list
of `Predicate<module>` based on the parsed arguments, which is used to construct a `FindCommand`.

During the execution of `FindCommand#execute()`, each predicate is applied one by one to the `FilteredList`, the contents of the `FilteredList` are copied
before the next predicate is applied.

NOTE: Should one of the predicate result an empty `Filtered List`, it is possible to skip the rest of the predicates.

Finally, a `FilteredList` of `Modules` that passes all of the filters will be displayed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Requirements.

* **Module field requirements:** Information from the `archivedModules.json` would have to be abstracted out
as individual fields in the `ArchivedModule` object.
** pros: Added fields can be used for future developments.
** cons: Can potentially slow down `Module` construction and operations due to increased size for each `Module` object.

===== Aspect: Incremental development.

* **Adding new search filters:** Developing and integrating new filters.
** pros: Filters can be developed independently and incrementally, filters can be integrated based on priority.
** pros: Can be further adapted to search fields from `Deadline` and `Links`.
// end::searchfiltering[]

// tag::deadline[]
=== Deadline Feature

Deadline allows users to manage deadline tasks for a module.
Users can add, edit, mark as done or in-progress, tag priority,
sort and delete deadline tasks.

==== Add Deadline

===== 3.3.3.1. Implementation

The format to add deadline command is as follows:

....
deadline 2 a/add d/description t/dateAndTime
....

The add deadline mechanism is facilitated by `AddDeadlineCommand` and `AddDeadlineCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `MODULE_CODE`, `DESCRIPTION`, `DATE_AND_TIME`,
which will construct individual Deadline object to be added to the deadline list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how add deadline mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes:

....
deadline 2 a/add d/do homework t/2/12/2019 1645
....

Step 2. `LogicManager` would use `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse input from the user.

Step 3. `ModuleBookParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective parser.
In this case, `DeadlineCommandParser` is being created from the COMMAND.WORD: `deadline` and
the user’s input would be passed in as a parameter.

Step 4. `DeadlineCommandParser` would then determine which action is being used and creates the respective parser.
In this case, `AddDeadlineCommandParser` is created and user's input would be parsed in as a ArgumentMultimap parameter.

Step 5. `AddDeadlineCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user’s input before creating
and returning a `AddDeadlineCommand` with `index` and `Deadline` as its attribute.

Step 6. `LogicManager` would execute `AddDeadlineCommand#execute()`,
checks whether there is an existing module,
then adds the `TrackedModule` into the `Model` which is handled by the `ModelManager`.

Step 7. `AddDeadlineCommand` would return a `CommandResult`
to the `LogicManager` which would then be returned back to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add deadline operation works:

.Add Deadline Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== 3.3.3.2. Design Considerations
Aspect: Data Structure used to support add command

*  Alternative 1(Current choice) : Use of ArrayList to store deadline tasks of each module.
** Pros: Other commands (eg. edit, sort, delete) can be easily supported
by a list operations.
** Pros: One and only one list is created for each TrackedModule.
** Cons: More difficult to maintain over the course of the project.
New commands(eg. done, priority) need to edit and maintain the list constantly.
** Cons: Potential side effects from certain commands.

// end::deadline[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Link Management Feature

The link management feature allows users to add and manage a set of website links that will be associated with a given module.

==== Implementation

The link management feature is facilitated by the `link` class.

Each `link` object is stored in an `ArrayList<Link>`, which in turn is stored in its corresponding `TrackedModule`.

The link feature currently supports add, delete, edit and launch commands.

An example usage scenario of an *add link* operation is given below and the behavior of the link management feature is shown.

1. The user launches the application with an existing save file. `ModuleBook` is initialized with existing `TrackedModule`.

2. The user inputs `link MODULE_INDEX a/add n/LINK_NAME l/LINK_URL` to add a link with name `LINK_NAME`, linked to `LINK_URL` to the `TrackedModule` with the corresponding `MODULE_INDEX`.

3. `LogicManager` receives user input and parses it using `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand()`.  `ModuleBookParser` reads the `COMMAND_WORD` and identifies the input as a `Link` related command and passes the input to `LinkCommandParser`.

4. `LinkCommandParser` determines the `add` action required through the `a/` prefix argument. It then proceeds to pass the relevant input to  `AddLinkCommandParser`.

5. `AddLinkCommandParser` checks for the validity of `LINK_URL` given by the user and creates the relevant `Link` and `AddLinkCommand` objects.

6. `AddLinkCommand` calls `Model#get(MODULE_INDEX)` to find the required module. If it does not exist or is not currently tracked, `AddLinkCommand` throws a `CommandException`. Otherwise, it then proceeds to call `TrackedModule#hasLinkTitle(LINK_NAME)` to check for an existing `Link` object with the same `LINK_NAME`.

7. If such a `Link` object exists, `AddLinkCommand` aborts and throws a `CommandException`. Otherwise, the created `Link` will be added to the specified `TrackedModule`.

8. If the operation is successful, a `CommandResult` with the success message will be returned.

image::AddLinkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Reference of add link to module function from sequence diagram shown above
image::AddLinkCommandSequenceDiagramExtension.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Data structure used for link management

* Alternative 1 (current choice): All `TrackedModule` maintain a `ArrayList<Link>`. Adding `Link` objects will add to this `ArrayList`.

** Pros: Easy to implement and edit for beginner programmers.

** Cons: Accessing and editing existing `Link` might be less efficient. If number of `Link` objects maintained increases, `ArrayList` may not be optimal.

* Alternative 2: Use `HashSet<Link>` to maintain `Link` in each `TrackedModule`

** Pros: Reduces access time, since `Link` objects can be obtained by giving `LINK_TITLE`, rather than searching the list linearly for a matching object.

** Cons: Difficult to add features. Future implmentations may add a `Priority` feature to `Link` objects. `HashSet` does not support any form of sorting and thus may pose a problem.
