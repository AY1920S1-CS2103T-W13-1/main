* ModBook is a module planning application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* ModBook helps to track deadlines and tasks, sends reminders, as well as information on modules to help students plan their timetables.
* Our target audience are currently NUS computing students, but we intend to expand our scope in future versions.
